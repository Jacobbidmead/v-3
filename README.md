Personal Portfolio rebuild.

My current projects code base is a mess - I decided to rebuild the project and make it more manageable, and practice a few technolgies in the process.

Tech stack - Migrating from JS and create-react-app, with CSS styling to TypeScript & Next.js with styled components, but still using MUI & Framer motion for some of the UI & animations

Im following modern convetions on how to structure a project, with clean commits and using Jest to test my components as I build.

Im planning to use Hygraph CMS to hold all content, meaning I wont need to post a code release when chaging the site.

Organising the code base is making me very satisfied! 

Work in progress but should be a fast build as its essentially a static site with some animations and limited JS
